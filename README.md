MediPredict: AI-Powered Medical Disease Prediction
MediPredict is an advanced, user-friendly platform for medical disease prediction and health advice. It combines machine learning, interactive web technology, and a rule-based chatbot to help users understand their symptoms and receive actionable recommendations. The system is designed for both healthcare professionals and the general public, making medical insights accessible, transparent, and easy to use.

What Does MediPredict Do?
Predicts likely diseases based on user-reported symptoms and their severity.
Suggests precautions and provides mapped doctor recommendations for each predicted disease.
Offers fallback advice to visit a general physician if no specific doctor is mapped.
Allows users to download a PDF summary of their results for sharing or future reference.
Includes a medical chatbot for rule-based health queries and information.
Supports model training and evaluation via interactive Jupyter notebooks, enabling experimentation with multiple machine learning algorithms.
Tech Stack
Python 3.8+ – Core programming language
Streamlit – Interactive web app for disease prediction
Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost – Data processing and machine learning
FPDF – PDF generation for downloadable results
Jupyter Notebooks – Data exploration, model training, and evaluation
Azure App Service – Cloud deployment for scalable, secure access
Other libraries: PIL, joblib, difflib, etc.

# Cursor Medical

This project is a medical data analysis and chatbot system. It includes data exploration, disease-centric modeling, and a rule-based chatbot for medical queries.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Raw and processed data files (CSV)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/` - Source code (Python scripts)
- `models/` - Trained models and encoders
- `features/` - Feature files
- `outputs/` - Generated outputs (plots, reports, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Run scripts from the `src/` directory as needed.

## Usage
- Use the notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- Use the scripts in `src/` for running the chatbot, training models, and data processing.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
